ðŸ”Ž It looks at music files and detects their genre.

## 0. How does it work?
There are a lot of IA-based projects to detect the genre of songs, but it only covers "big" music genres (*pop*, *rock* and *jazz* for example).

This project consists in detecting very specific genres like *neurofunk*, *dubstep*, *lofi*, and *rap*. To do so, the program uses YouTube API
to get videos matching the song name. Then, with these videos, we can find useful information by taking a look at:
- the channel name (UKF Dubstep, House nation),
- some key words in the description,
- the tags.

If youtube API is not enough, we could use soundcloud, spotify, and deezer APIs.
